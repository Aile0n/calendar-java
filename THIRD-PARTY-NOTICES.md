## How to verify or regenerate this list

If you have Maven available, you can generate an authoritative license inventory:

- Show declared licenses in the dependency tree:
  mvn -q org.codehaus.mojo:license-maven-plugin:2.4.0:aggregate-add-third-party -DdownloadLicenses=true

This will create a THIRD-PARTY file under target/ listing dependencies and their licenses as detected from POM metadata. Always review the output, especially for artifacts with custom or unusual license metadata.
